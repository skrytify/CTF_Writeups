When we click on the red area URL changed to something else.
 
So I tried something else like “test”.
 
Here we can see it has displayed something new. Then I started thinking what can I do.
After a time, I thought of getting web shell. 
Parameter: ${system($_GET[cmd])}&cmd=ls
And we got it.
 
Here are the same files that we had downloaded earlier. 
So I tried getting back on the directory. Using “ls ../”
 
Here we can find a file name flag so let’s read it using cat.
: cmd=cat ../ flagyE9AQ
